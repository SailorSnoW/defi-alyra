Using hardhat for easier debugging with the hardhat console.

Forked contracts from UniswapV2 and SushiSwap are updated to 0.8.10 and don't use SafeMath anymore.

The excercise is divided in 3 different part.

## :unicorn: 1) Fork UniswapV2

Main UniswapV2 forked contracts (doesn't include interfaces/libraries)

##### *`UniswapV2Pair.sol`*

##### *`UniswapV2ERC20.sol`*

##### *`UniswapV2Factory.sol`*

&nbsp;
Forked contracts are situed in

##### *`contracts/1_UniswapV2Forked/`*

- ##### *`LLSwapPair.sol`*

- ##### *`LLSwapERC20.sol`*

- ##### *`LLSwapFactory.sol`*

&nbsp;

## :sushi: 2) Fork SushiSwap

As asked, only one SushiSwap contract got forked

##### *`MasterChef.sol`*
&nbsp;
Forked contracts are situed in

##### *`contracts/2_SushiSwapForked`*

- ##### *`LLMasterChef.sol`*

&nbsp;

## :dollar: 3) Staking

The staking contract rewards user staking *LLS* tokens in the contract.
When the user deposit *LLS* tokens, this contract give to the user *stkLLS,* which represent shares of the deposited *LLS*.

Gived shares are determined with the following compute:
`LLS deposit amount` * (`supply of all gived stkLLS` / `LLS staked in the contract`)

New *LLS* can be minted by this contract every hour. These minted LLS are the rewards which users can withdraw with the previously deposited *LLS* tokens

User can withdraw their staked *LLS* by burning the *stkLLS*.

Received *LLS* are determined with the following compute:
`stkLLS burned amount` / (`supply of all gived stkLLS` * `LLS staked in the contract`)
&nbsp;

Staking contract are situed at

##### *`contracts/3_Staking/LLStaking.sol`*

&nbsp;

## Tokens

#### *`LLStake (LLS)`* 

*LLS* is the token used by the *MasterChef* and *Staking* contracts to reward stakers and liquidity providers.

contract of *LLS* token is situed at

##### *`contracts/2_SushiSwapForked/tokens/LLS.sol`*
&nbsp;
#### *`staked LLStake (stkLLS)`* 

*stkLLS* is the token given in return when staking *LLS*. They represent the shares of the staking contract.
&nbsp;

#### *`Fake tokens (fUSDT, fUSDC, fDAI)`*

Fake tokens are basic ERC20 tokens which is mintable without any restriction.

:warning: should be used ONLY in a developement and testing purpose.

contracts of fake tokens are situed in:

##### *`contracts/1_UniswapV2Forked/tokens/`*

- ##### *`fUSDT.sol`*

- ##### *`fUSDC.sol`*

- ##### *`fDAI.sol`*
&nbsp;

#### *`Wrapped Ether (WETH)`*

*WETH* is a fork of the actual [WETH9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) contract.

It wrap Ethers in a ERC20 token.
